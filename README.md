<p align="center">
   Rocket Upload is a web application that allows users to upload files to a server using drag and drop functionality. This repository contains the source code for the Rocket Upload application.
</p>
<p align="center">
    Currently, the Rocket Upload application supports uploading files by dragging and dropping them onto the drop area or clicking in the box area to select file. There is no support for uploading multiple files simultaneously. However, future versions of the application may include additional features for managing uploaded files, such as the ability to view, download or delete them.
